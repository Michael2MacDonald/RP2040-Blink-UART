The Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers start code execution from an address location specified in the vector table. This vector table can be found in `/kernel/vectors.S`. The kernel sets this vector table entry to point to the address of a set of reset functions located in `/kernel/reset.S`. These functions reset/zero memory, set some registers, etc. It then jumps to the `_startup()` function located in `/kernel/startup.cpp`. This function initializes some MCU peripherals, initializes the kernel scheduler, creates the mandatory `_MAIN` thread, and jumps to the `_MAIN` thread to execute using the `enter_main` function located in `/kernel/enter_main.S`. At this point the user's program is running.
